This repository contains the ML backend powering a energy consumption prediction.

Inspired by the [SFOE's energy consumption dashboard](https://www.energiedashboard.admin.ch/strom/stromverbrauch), I figured it would be a great opportunity to showcase an end-to-end ML project, going over the challenges one encounters during

- Problem Understanding
- Data Ingestion
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning Modelling
- Industrialization
- Deployment

> I _heavily_ encourage you to check out the write-up to make sense of this repo, as it goes through each stage methodically.

## Repo structure

The repo is structured as follows

```bash 
â”œâ”€â”€ data_checks.ipynb # Used to manually check our data
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml 
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ img 
â”œâ”€â”€ model_server # ML backend
â”œâ”€â”€ nb-dev # Notebooks created during the EDA/Modelling phase
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ sanity_checks.ipynb # Used to manually check our some inputs
â”œâ”€â”€ tests # pytests
â””â”€â”€ viz # Visualization built for the writeup
```

## Running the backend

The backend is meant to be run as a dockerized app, running off some machine. This project's [write-up](swissenergy.arthurgassner.ch) goes in depth about how to run the backend.
