This repository contains the ML backend powering an **energy consumption prediction dashboard**.

Inspired by the [SFOE's energy consumption dashboard](https://www.energiedashboard.admin.ch/strom/stromverbrauch), I figured it would be a great opportunity to talk about an end-to-end ML project, going over the challenges one encounters during

- Problem Understanding
- Data Ingestion
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning Modelling
- Industrialization
- Deployment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I _heavily_ encourage you to check out the ðŸš€ [**write-up**](https://swissenergy.arthurgassner.ch) ðŸš€ to make sense of this repo, as it goes through each stage methodically.

> [!NOTE]  
> The code for the frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/arthurgassner/swissenergy-frontend).

## Repo structure

The repo is structured as follows

```bash 
â”œâ”€â”€ img/ 
â”œâ”€â”€ model_server/ # ML backend
â”œâ”€â”€ nb-dev/ # Notebooks created during the EDA/Modelling phase
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/ # pytests
â”œâ”€â”€ viz/ # Visualization built for the writeup
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore 
â”œâ”€â”€ .pre-commit-config.yaml 
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ data_checks.ipynb # Used to manually check our data
â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yml 
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ sanity_checks.ipynb # Used to manually check our some inputs
```

## Running the backend

The backend is meant to be run as a dockerized app, running off some machine. This project's [write-up](https://swissenergy.arthurgassner.ch) goes in depth about how to run the backend.
